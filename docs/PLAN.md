# Plan

1. get the python app a good cli argument
2. create a config file
3. create a prompt management system
4. Add Logging
5. Add Tools and MCP Servers
6. Add a Browser tool
7. Add a Vector Database 
8. Index a Book in the Vector Database
9. Do EVALs


## What I want to learn 

1. an app in terminal, like how to do args well and print pretty text in terminal
2. manage the prompt well, I feel like the prompts can become a pain quickly, maybe we should have a versionning
3. Manage logging, maybe add a database, and hopefuly tracing 


# TODO 

## Database

1. create a UI in the terminal to select the conversation
2. let the user select old or new conversation
3. print the conversation history if a user selects


## Tools

1. create a Tool Class
2. Create a Tool Registry to manage the tools and their description
3. create first mcp
4. create classes for STEPS
5. Create a tool that list can be used to list other tools. Like Math would list addition and substractions

## Logging

1. create a config 
2. create log files 
3. ****
